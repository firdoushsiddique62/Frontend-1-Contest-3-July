Task
You have been tasked with designing a complex UI for a website using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Your UI should include the following components:

A Bootstrap-based header with a responsive navigation bar. The navigation bar should include a heading, links to different sections of the website, and a search bar. The navigation bar should collapse into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.
Below the header, a Bootstrap carousel should be implemented to showcase multiple images with captions and calls-to-action. The carousel should have indicators and controls, and it should transition smoothly between slides.
Next, create a custom CSS section with a flex div. The flex div should have three divs inside of it. Each div should contain an image and a short description.
After the custom flex section, implement a photo gallery using CSS Grid. The photo gallery should have 3 rows and 3 columns, displaying a total of 9 images. Use public images from websites like Unsplash or Pexels. The images should be responsive and maintain their aspect ratios. The grid should look like the one in the ui given.
Add a Bootstrap card section, displaying three cards with an image, title, description, and a call-to-action button. The cards should have a slight drop shadow, and the buttons should have a smooth hover effect. the cards should go from being shown in a row to a column as screen size becomes small.
Lastly, include a Bootstrap footer with various links, a copyright statement, and a back-to-top button.
Your UI should be responsive, user-friendly, and visually appealing. You should also ensure that your code is well-organized, properly commented, and follows best practices for HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Use any images you want, and you are even allowed to edit the text content wherever you want.
